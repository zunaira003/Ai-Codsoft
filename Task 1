Build a simple chatbot that responds to user inputs based on predefined rules. Use if-else statements or pattern matching techniques to identify user queries and provide appropriate responses. This will give you a basic understanding of natural

language processing and conversation flow.




import random

# Define a list of predefined user queries and their corresponding responses
responses = {
    "hi": "Hello! How can I assist you today?",
    "hello": "Hi there! How can I help?",
    "how are you": "I'm just a computer program, but thanks for asking!",
    "what's your name": "I'm a chatbot. You can call me ChatGPT.",
    "bye": "Goodbye! If you have more questions, feel free to ask later.",
    "thanks": "You're welcome!",
    "default": "I'm sorry, I didn't understand that. Can you please rephrase your question?",
}

# Main chatbot function
def chatbot_response(user_input):
    # Convert user input to lowercase for case-insensitive matching
    user_input = user_input.lower()

    # Check if the user input matches any predefined queries
    if user_input in responses:
        return responses[user_input]
    else:
        return responses["default"]

# Chatbot interaction loop
print("Chatbot: Hello! How can I assist you today?")
while True:
    user_input = input("You: ")
    if user_input.lower() == "exit":
        print("Chatbot: Goodbye!")
        break
    response = chatbot_response(user_input)
    print("Chatbot:", response)
